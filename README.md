# Simply Daylight
A Garmin Connect IQ widget to show the times of the next sunrise and sunset in a large font.

The calculation depends on time and location.

I have taken it from the excellent code by Harald Hoyer (https://github.com/haraldh/SunCalc/). He wrote it for his SunCalc widget available at https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/87b86650-a443-43ea-9dcb-29e4051a5722 that shows not only sunrise and sunset but much more.
